## Pathology Lexicon A-Z

A flutter mobile app for the [University of Cape Town (UCT)](https://www.uct.ac.za/) [Pathology Learning Centre](http://www.pathologylearningcentre.uct.ac.za/)

Available on the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pathology-lexicon-a-z/id1488333058) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jurgengeitner.pathlexi&pli=1)

Note that the code is complete but the high-res images have been removed as they are not licensed under the same license as the code (The Mozilla Public License 2.0.). Core code heavily inspired by the Flutter Demo App [Veggie Seasons](https://github.com/flutter/samples/tree/main/veggieseasons)

The Pathology Lexicon A-Z mobile application is developed in support of the UCT MBChB Language of Medicine course. My contribution was coding and design. Colleagues Dr Jane Yeats, Dr Frans-Peter Botha and Ms Nolubabalo Tam provided pathology descriptions and translations. It is hoped that the app will help students become confident users of the descriptive language of pathology, specifically as it relates to macroscopic pathology. The app came about because in pathology particular adjectives are used quite specifically, and without a grasp of this lexicon, students are on the back foot when studying pathology texts or when required to describe a pathological lesion themselves. This may be an even bigger hurdle for students whose first language is not English, so the App includes a pronunciation guide (voice), and isiXhosa and Afrikaans equivalents for each word.
